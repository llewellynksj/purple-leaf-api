## User Experience (UX)

### **Purpose**

Purple Leaf is a compassionate online platform dedicated to honoring and remembering losses experienced during pregnancy or shortly after birth. By adding a leaf to the Tree of Remembrance, users can commemorate their loss, sharing as much or as little information as they feel comfortable with. The platform allows users to specify the type of loss, and optionally share names, dates, messages, and images that hold personal significance.

Once a memory is added to the Remembrance Tree, users have the option to view another randomly selected memory from the community, fostering a supportive environment where shared experiences can bring comfort and understanding. For those who may find this overwhelming, opting out is always an option.

Additionally, Purple Leaf provides links to external support groups, ensuring that users have access to further assistance during their healing journey.

## Features

### **Accessibility**

In addition to being best practice, having an accessible website is extremely high on the list of requirements for the target audience. Close attention has been paid to the following in order to ensure the site is as accessible as possible:

- Clear and simple font styling, avoiding any cursive or calligraphic scripts.
- Contrasting colour scheme, but avoiding colours that are too bold.
- Use of semantic HTML
- Ensuring all images have an alt description for screen readers or where the image cannot be loaded. Also ensuring that these are as descriptive as possible.
